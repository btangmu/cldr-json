# cldr-json

JSON distribution of [CLDR](http://cldr.unicode.org/) locale data for internationalization

### Latest Release
[![Latest Official Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/tag/unicode-org/cldr-json?sort=semver)](https://github.com/unicode-org/cldr-json/releases/latest)

Although XML (not JSON) is the "official" format for all CLDR data, this data is programatically generated from the
corresponding XML, using the CLDR tooling.

This JSON data is generated using only data that has achieved
`draft="contributed"` or `draft="approved"` status in the CLDR. This is the same threshold
as is used by the [ICU](https://icu.unicode.org) (International Components for Unicode).

See [UPDATING.md](./UPDATING.md) for details on building or customizing this data yourself.

### Who uses cldr-json?

See [USERS.md](./USERS.md) for a list of libraries
which use this data.

## Package Organization

Because the CLDR is so large and contains so many different types of information, the JSON data
here is grouped into packages by functionality. For each type of functionality, there are two
available packages: The "modern" packages, which contain the set of locales listed as modern
coverage targets by the CLDR subcommittee, and the "full" packages, which contain the complete
set of locales, including those in the corresponding modern packages.

See [PACKAGES.md](./PACKAGES.md) for the full package list.
## Downloading
### Tagged Releases

See the [releases](https://github.com/unicode-org/cldr-json/releases) page for a list of cldr-json releases. As of v38, all
JSON data is contained in this single repository.

The GitHub release page also contains .zip files where you can download all full or modern data in a single .zip.

## npm packages

Installation using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com):

    $ npm install <package-name> , where <package-name> is one of the package names mentioned above, for example:

    $ npm install cldr-dates-full

(Note that bower is deprecated, please use npm.)

## Bug reports / Contributing

CLDR does not use Github's issue tracking system to track bugs.  If you find an error in
the data contained here, please file a new ticket at [Unicode Jira](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/projects/CLDR/issues)
