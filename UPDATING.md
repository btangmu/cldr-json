# Updating CLDR-JSON

## Prerequisites

- A UNIX-like environment
- git
- java and maven
- plenty of memory

## Instructions

### Setup

Check out repos (If you use a different directory layout, see Customization)

1. Check out this repo [`cldr-json`](https://github.com/unicode-org/cldr-json). (Note: Big.)
2. Check out the [`cldr-staging`](https://github.com/unicode-org/cldr-staging) repo as a sibling to cldr-json. This will be the data source. (Note: Very big.) Use a release tag if possible.
3. Check out the [`cldr`](https://github.com/unicode-org/cldr) repo as a sibling to cldr-json and set it up so [maven builds are possible](https://cldr.unicode.org/development/maven).
4. Create the file `local-config.sh`, make it executable, and set `VERSION` appropriately; for example, `VERSION="44.0.0-ALPHA2"`.

Make sure your `cldr-json` directory is otherwise clean (`git status`)

### Building

1. `cd` to `cldr-json`
2. *Delete* the `cldr-json/cldr-json` subdirectory (the subdirectory of `cldr-json`).  This way, git will tell you what has changed, and you can see if any files failed to regenerate.
3. Run the script `cldr-generate-json.sh`
4. Data will be updated in the recreated `cldr-json` subdirectory.

#### Troubleshooting

- `git status` is your friend. At least, until too many files change.
- If a `cldr-json/supplemental` or `cldr-json/other` or other such subdirectory shows up not prefixed with `cldr-`, there's probably something wrong with the `cldr-json` mapping.
  - Sadly, there is no documentation about how to update the tooling. TODO: [CLDR-16445](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/CLDR-16445)

### Updating the Repository

1. Run `git checkout -b ...` to create a new branch.
2. Run `git status` to check whether there are any newly added files/directories such as for new locales, or removed files/directories.  If you see any files or directories named `other…`, stop, because there's a generation problem.
3. Run `git add cldr-json` to add the entire nested `cldr-json` subdirectory.
4. Make a pull request (`git commit ...`, `git push`, ...), get it approved, and merge it.

### Publishing

1. Run the script `cldr-generate-zip.sh` to generate zipfiles under `dist/`; their names will include `VERSION`, for example: `cldr-44.0.0-ALPHA2-json-full.zip`.
2. Create a release tag matching VERSION in this repository.  Create a GitHub release, use other [releases](https://github.com/unicode-org/cldr-json/releases) as a guide.
3. Update the npm packages. Each sub-subdirectory of `cldr-json/cldr-json` is a separate npm package. The following script will preview
(dry run) publishing to npm under the `beta` tag. Check the version carefully!

```shell
(cd cldr-json; npm login; for repo in $(ls); do (cd $repo; npm publish --tag beta --dry-run); done)
```
  - `npm login` is needed, otherwise a dry run may seem to succeed but without `--dry-run` there may be a mysterious error message such as `npm ERR! 404  'cldr-annotations-derived-full@44.0.0' is not in this registry.`
  - `--tag` should be followed by `alpha`, `beta`, or `latest`. It should NOT be followed by a full tag such as `44.0.0-ALPHA2` since that would result in `npm ERR! Tag name must not be a valid SemVer range: 44.0.0-ALPHA2`.

4. Upload the zipfiles from `dist/` to the release page, by dragging and dropping them where it says "Attach binaries by dropping them here or selecting them."

### Customization

See `cldr-config.sh` for customization options.

You can create an executable script named `local-config.sh` with
values to update, for example `VERSION`, `TYPES`, `MATCH` or `DRAFTSTATUS`

Example, if you have a different directory layout:

```shell
# VERSION defaults to calculating the version
VERSION=43.0.0-ALPHA2

# CLDR_DIR defaults to ../cldr
CLDR_DIR=../cldr-maint-43

# INDATA defaults to ../cldr-staging/production
INDATA=../cldr-staging-other/production
```
